              Salsify (left side) is compared with WebRTC in Google Chrome 65
              (right side) over a network path whose data rate varies with time,
              then over a network that experiences occasional one-second
              outages. Both Salsify and WebRTC experience glitches when the
              network is degraded, but Salsify's joint control of the video
              codec and transport protocol allows it to recover more quickly,
              matching the compressed video output to the network's varying
              capacity.

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <h4 class="mb-3">Is this a startup company?</h4>
                    <p class="mb-5">No.</p>

                    <h4 class="mb-3">Are you sure? Your website looks like a startup company&rsquo;s.</h4>
                    <p class="mb-5">It's just the HTML template! They all look like this. We promise, this is an academic research project at a university. The code is open-source, and the paper and raw data are open-access. The hope is that these ideas will influence the industry and lead to better real-time video for everybody.</p>

                    <h4 class="mb-3">What is the main idea of Salsify?</h4>
                    <p class="mb-3">Today's real-time video apps are
built out of two separate components: a “video codec” that compresses
video, and a “transport protocol” that transmits packets of data and
estimates how many can be sent without overloading the network. These
components are designed and built separately, often by different
companies, then combined into an overall program such as Skype or
FaceTime.</p>

<p class="mb-3">Each component has its own control loop. The transport protocol has a &ldquo;congestion-control&rdquo; that tries to figure out how
fast the network is, and the codec has its own &ldquo;rate-control&rdquo; algorithm
that tries to make the compressed video match what the transport
protocol is telling it. We found that these dueling control loops&mdash;which are
found in Skype, FaceTime, Hangouts, and the WebRTC reference implementation&mdash;can yield
suboptimal results over unpredictable networks.</p>

<p class="mb-5">
Salsify&rsquo;s main contribution is in <strong>jointly controlling</strong> the frame-by-frame
control of compression and the packet-by-packet control of
transmission in a single control loop. This lets the video stream track
the network’s varying capacity, avoiding stalls <a href="#in-action">(see the video above)</a>.

<h4 class="mb-3">How big is Salsify&rsquo;s improvement, overall?</h4>

<p class="mb-5">
The results
are <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/nsdi18/nsdi18-fouladi.pdf">in
the paper</a>, and
the <a href="https://github.com/excamera/salsify-results">raw data</a>
are available on GitHub, but bottom line, on average across our
network tests, compared with Skype, FaceTime, Hangouts, and Chrome's
WebRTC with and without VP9-SVC, <strong>Salsify reduced delay (at the 95th
percentile) by 4.6&times;, while also improving SSIM by about 60% (2.1
dB)</strong>.
</p>

<h4 class="mb-3">Can I use Salsify to talk to my parents?</h4>

<p class="mb-5">
You probably don&rsquo;t want to, at least not
yet. The <a href="https://github.com/excamera/alfalfa">implementation</a>
is only for Linux and doesn't have audio. The value is mostly in
demonstrating the benefit of Salsify&rsquo;s design and in allowing
other researchers (and industry) to replicate our results, with the
intent that Salsify&rsquo;s ideas will be incorporated by others
and improve the quality of real-time video in many applications.
</p>

<h4 class="mb-3">How did you evaluate Salsify?</h4>
<p class="mb-5">
We played the same video through Salsify&rsquo;s sender, and the
sender programs for Skype, FaceTime (on a Mac), Google Hangouts, and
WebRTC in Google Chrome. We allowed the sender to transmit over an
emulated network to its receiver, captured the receiver&rsquo;s video,
and calculated the delay and quality of each frame. We tested different
kinds of emulated networks: LTE, slower cellular links, and long-distance Wi-Fi.
</p>

<h4 class="mb-3">In detail, how did you evaluate Salsify?</h4>

  <div class="row measurement-sys align-items-center pt-3 mb-4">
    <div class="col-md-6 mb-4">
      <a href="images/testbed.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="images/testbed.jpeg"></a>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6 pl-5">
      <a href="images/measurement.svg" target="_blank"><img src="images/measurement.svg"></a>
    </div>
  </div>

<p class="mb-5">
We built a <a href="https://github.com/excamera/alfalfa">prototype
implementation</a> of Salsify, including a video-aware transport
protocol, a VP8 video codec with the ability to save/restore internal
state, and a unified control loop. We then compared it end-to-end with
Skype, FaceTime, Hangouts, and WebRTC (as implemented in Google
Chrome, with and without scalable/layered video coding). We emulated a
hardware webcam and played a reproducible 720p60 test video through
each program, with each frame tagged with a 2D barcode. We timestamped
each frame on exit, using the hardware clock on a Blackmagic Decklink
card. The unmodified sender transmitted over an emulated time-varying
network connection (using <a href="https://github.com/keithw/multisend">cellsim</a>/<a href="http://mahimahi.mit.edu">mahimahi</a>), to an unmodified
receiver. We ran the receiver program fullscreen on an HDMI output,
which we captured and timestamped using the same Blackmagic hardware
clock that timestamped the frame when emitted. We recognized the 2D
barcode (which was still recognizable even after lossy video
compression), and computed the delay and quality (structural
similarity, or SSIM) of each frame. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first <a href="https://github.com/excamera/salsify-results">dataset</a>
giving an end-to-end frame-by-frame measurement of the quality and delay of a diverse array of
commercial and research codebases for real-time Internet video.
</p>

<h4 class="mb-3">Don't current systems have some pretty sophisticated mechanisms for recovering from packet loss?</h4>

<p class="mb-3">
They certainly have
<a href="https://www.callstats.io/2015/10/30/error-resilience-mechanisms-webrtc-video/">sophisticated
mechanisms at their disposal</a>; video transmission over a lossy
channel is a very well-studied problem. However, when we did the
measurement carefully, we found that these mechanisms don't always work
that well in practice, and Salsify's (much simpler, functional) approach
works as well or better <a href="#in-action">(see the video above)</a>,
or Figure 6(d) of the paper.
</p>

<p class="mb-5">
There may not be an academically interesting reason for
this&mdash;perhaps commercial systems just have a large toolbox of
loss-recovery strategies but aren't well-tuned about when to use each
one, at least not for the network conditions that we
evaluated. Salsify&rsquo;s main innovation is in jointly controlling
codec rate-control with transport congestion-control, not in inventing
a better mechanism for loss recovery, so we don't want to overstress
this point. However, we do think that our evaluation may be the first
end-to-end measurement of frame-by-frame video quality and delay
across a variety of current commercial and research codebases, and to
the extent the findings show surprising weaknesses in the commercial
status quo, the lesson may be that more such measurements are in order.
</p>

<h4 class="mb-3">Why do you need your video codec to be implemented
in a purely functional style?</h4>
<p class="mb-3">
Current video codecs, including ours, cannot reliably predict the
compressed size of an individual video frame in advance. Instead,
codecs generally try to control the &ldquo;bitrate&rdquo; over several
frames (e.g. through a VBV constraint).  If the encoder makes a frame that's too big compared with
what the transport protocol thinks the network can accommodate, the
application will generally send it anyway, and then, knowing
that it has probably just caused congestion, the application might
then pause <em>input</em> to the video encoder for a little bit to allow
the congestion that it just caused to clear.
</p>

<p class="mb-3">
This is not a great strategy, because the network still gets
congested. A better plan, if the encoder makes a compressed frame
that's too big, would be to tell the encoder to try again&mdash;either
by re-encoding the same frame with lower quality settings, or by
plucking a new frame off the camera and encoding that more-recent
frame&mdash;with quality settings more likely to produce a compressed
frame that won't congest the network. In effect, rather than having a
fixed frame rate, it would be better to send frames only at times when
they won't provoke packet loss and queueing delay.
</p>

<p class="mb-3">
Salsify uses a purely functional video codec to achieve this. Our
video codec is 100% conformant with the Google VP8 format, but has
one major trick: the encode and decode functions are purely functional,
with no side effects, and represent the inter-frame &ldquo;state&rdquo;
of the decoder explicitly. This allows Salsify to make the encoder
compress a frame relative to an arbitrary decoder state, allowing
the application to safely skip frames on <em>output</em> from
the encoder, not just on input.
</p>

<p class="mb-5">
Salsify's codec allows the sender to send frames when it's pretty sure
they won't congest the network (discarding already-encoded frames if
necessary) rather than sticking to a fixed frame rate. It also allows
the codec to produce frames that more closely match the available
network capacity, by simply producing two versions of each frame:
one with slightly higher quality than the previous successful option,
and one with slightly lower quality. The application chooses from
among these options (or no option) after seeing the actual compressed size
of each option.
</p>

<h4 class="mb-3">Okay, but if you didn't have a purely functional video codec,
could you still achieve Salsify&rsquo;s performance?</h4>

<p class="mb-5">
Maybe! <strong>If</strong> mainstream video encoders could allow the
application to discard already-encoded frames, and <strong>if</strong>
they could accurately hit a frame-size target, then Salsify's purely
functional video codec would probably not be necessary. The first
<em>may</em> be achievable with smart use of reference invalidation
(although not clear&mdash;what about ancillary inter-frame state
stored in probability tables?). The second <em>may</em> be achievable
with more work (and more cycles) put into intra-frame rate control.
So, it's possible. But it was a heck of a lot easier to do when
the codec exposes a way to save and restore its internal state.
</p>

<h4 class="mb-3">When you say &ldquo;purely functional video codec,&rdquo; does it mean anything more than being able to dump and restore the internal state of the encoder and decoder between frames?</h4>

<p class="mb-5">
No, that&rsquo;s pretty much all we mean by it. If you have that, then
the decoder can be described as a function that takes in a state and a
compressed frame, and produces a modified state and an image for
display. The encoder can be described as a function that takes in a
state, an image, and some sort of quality settings, and produces a
modified state and a compressed frame.
</p>

<h4 class="mb-3">Does this require a software codec?</h4>

<p class="mb-5">
Not really&mdash;it requires a codec that can export and import its
internal state, or can otherwise accurately hit a target size for an
individual compressed frame and can &ldquo;cancel&rdquo; an
already-encoded frame (including its effect on references and
probability tables). Whether the codec is implemented in software
or hardware isn&rsquo;t important to Salsify.
</p>

<h4 class="mb-3">How is it possible that a VP8 encoder written by one graduate student in a few months can outperform production-grade VP9 and H.264 encoders?</h4>

<p class="mb-5">
Because it&rsquo;s not a fair fight between codecs&mdash;Salsify is a different way
of putting the pieces (compression and transmission) together, not a
new compression format.  To the extent these results persuade you of
anything, they should make you think that in the domain of Internet
videoconferencing, further innovation in video <em>codecs</em> may
have reached the point of diminishing returns, but
video <em>systems</em> still have lots of low-hanging fruit.
</p>

<h4 class="mb-3">Is Salsify a &ldquo;cross-layer&rdquo; approach?</h4>
<p class="mb-5">
Not exactly, at least not in the way the term is typically used to
apply to systems
like <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~suman/pubs/apex.pdf">Apex</a>
or <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/szym/softcast/tr2.pdf">SoftCast</a>.
These systems reach into the physical layer and jointly handle
&ldquo;source coding&rdquo; (video compression) and &ldquo;channel
coding&rdquo; (error correction coding and modulation). By contrast,
Salsify is a conventional Internet application that sends UDP
datagrams point-to-point over the Internet, just like Skype, FaceTime,
and WebRTC (and almost like Hangouts, which sends UDP datagrams
through a nearby Google CDN node).

</p>

<h4 class="mb-3">What part of Salsify is new?</h4>
<p class="mb-3">
Really just the overall architecture. The compressed video format is
Google&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VP8">VP8</a>,
finalized in 2008 and largely superseded
by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VP9">VP9</a> and
H.265. Salsify&rsquo;s purely functional VP8 encoder/decoder is a
lightly modified version of the one we used last year
for <a href="http://ex.camera">ExCamera</a>, when the benefit was in
allowing us to subdivide video encoding into tiny threads (smaller
than the interval between key frames) and parallelize across thousands
of threads on AWS Lambda. This year, the benefit is in allowing
Salsify to explore an execution path of the video codec without
committing to it. Salsify's congestion-control scheme is based
on <a href="http://alfalfa.mit.edu">Sprout-EWMA</a>, which in turn
is based on earlier work in <a href="http://blizzard.cs.uwaterloo.ca/keshav/home/Papers/data/95/pp.pdf">packet-pair</a> and packet-train estimation
of available bandwidth. Salsify's loss-recovery strategy is related
to <a href="https://mosh.org">Mosh&rsquo;s</a> &ldquo;p-retransmissions.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="mb-5">
What&rsquo;s new, then, is the way the pieces are put together: the
joint control of codec rate-control and transport congestion-control,
and the use of a functional video codec to send encoded frames only at
moments when the network can accomodate them.
</p>

<h4 class="mb-3">Can industry incorporate Salsify?</h4>

<p class="mb-5">
Legally, sure, we'd love that, and we&rsquo;re eager to
help. Technically, it may not be so easy. It would be a lot simpler if
Salsify were just a better video codec, or a better transport
protocol.  Because Salsify is instead a better way of putting the
pieces together, we expect it will be harder to retrofit into an
existing application without significant refactoring. In our
conversations with industry, we&rsquo;ve found that the burden of
proof will be high to demonstrate (1) that Salsify&rsquo;s gains are
real, and (2) that they can&rsquo;t be achieved with less-intrusive
surgery to existing applications.
</p>

<h4 class="mb-3">What would you say to tomorrow&rsquo;s codec implementers?</h4>

<p class="mb-5">
Standardize an interface to export and import the encoder&rsquo;s and
decoder&rsquo;s internal state between frames! Even if the format of that state is
opaque and unstandardized across codecs, that&rsquo;s okay.  Last
year, we demonstrated how doing so can
allow <a href="http://ex.camera">fine-grained parallelization of
video encoding</a>. This year, it&rsquo;s letting Salsify explore
execution paths of the video codec without committing to them (to
match each frame&rsquo;s compressed size to the network capacity, and
skip already-encoded frames without penalty). We can&rsquo;t prove
that a save/restore interface is strictly necessary to achieve this
performance, but it makes things a heck of a lot easier and
simpler. This should be a requirement for all codecs going forward: exposing
the encoder and decoder only as stream operators with inaccessible, mutable,
internal state is terribly limiting and inconvenient.
</p>

<h4 class="mb-3">Why the name &ldquo;Salsify&rdquo;?</h4>
<p class="mb-5">
It's not a very interesting reason. Salsify comes from an older
project called &ldquo;ALFalfa,&rdquo; for the use
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-layer_framing">Application
Layer Framing</a> in video. Alfalfa gave way
to <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi13/technical-sessions/presentation/winstein">Sprout</a>,
a congestion-control scheme intended for real-time applications, and
now Salsify, a new design where congestion-control (in the transport
protocol) and rate control (in the video codec) are jointly controlled.
Alfalfa, Sprout, and Salsify are all plantish foods.
</p>

<h4 class="mb-3">Who&rsquo;s responsible for Salsify?</h4>

<p class="mb-3">
Salsify is led by <a href="https://github.com/sadjad">Sadjad
Fouladi</a>, a doctoral student in computer science at Stanford
University, along with fellow Stanford students John Emmons, Emre
Orbay, and Riad S. Wahby, as well as Catherine Wu, a junior at
Saratoga High School in Saratoga, California. The project is advised
by <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~keithw">Keith Winstein</a>, an
assistant professor of computer science.
</p>

<p class="mb-5">
Salsify was funded the National Science Foundation and the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Salsify has also received
support from Google, Huawei, VMware, Dropbox, Facebook, and
the <a href="https://platformlab.stanford.edu">Stanford Platform
Lab</a>.
